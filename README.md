# CS3891-DietRecommendation
This project is a diet recommendation service built as part of a final project at Vanderbilt University. We hope this project demonstrates a proof of concept of diet recommendation weighing both nutrient requirements and recipe tastes.

Our project is divided into sections: frontend and backend, delineated by their respective directories. To run our project, follow the below instructions:

## Frontend
Inside the `/frontend` directory, run:

`npm i`

`npm start`

This should load the webpage locally for you.

## Backend
Inside the `/backend` directory, run:

`python3 server.py`

This should start the backend locally for you. Please be sure to use `pip3 install x` for any missing package `x`.
